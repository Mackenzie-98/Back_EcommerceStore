# E-commerce API Backend - Project Brief

## Project Overview
A comprehensive, production-ready e-commerce API backend built with Flask Python. This system provides a complete foundation for modern e-commerce applications with advanced features including analytics, recommendations, and scalable architecture.

## Core Requirements

### Primary Objectives
1. **Complete E-commerce Backend**: Full API for product catalog, cart, orders, payments, and user management
2. **Advanced Analytics**: Real-time dashboards, sales tracking, conversion funnels, and business intelligence
3. **Scalable Architecture**: Designed to handle growth from startup to enterprise scale
4. **Modern Stack**: Flask-based with PostgreSQL, Redis, ElasticSearch integration
5. **Production Ready**: Security, monitoring, caching, and performance optimization

### Key Features
- **Product Management**: Complex product catalog with variants, categories, inventory tracking
- **User System**: Authentication, profiles, addresses, order history
- **Shopping Cart**: Persistent cart, guest checkout, discount system
- **Order Processing**: Complete checkout flow, payment integration, order management
- **Analytics Engine**: Business metrics, user behavior tracking, sales forecasting
- **Admin Panel**: Backend management interface for products, orders, users
- **Search & Recommendations**: Advanced product search and personalized recommendations

### Technical Stack
- **Backend Framework**: Flask with extensions
- **Database**: PostgreSQL with SQLAlchemy ORM
- **Cache**: Redis for sessions, cart, and performance
- **Search**: ElasticSearch for product search
- **Queue**: Celery for background tasks
- **Authentication**: JWT with refresh tokens
- **API Documentation**: Swagger/OpenAPI
- **Testing**: Comprehensive test suite

## Success Criteria
1. Complete API endpoints for all e-commerce functions
2. Sub-200ms response times for critical endpoints
3. Support for 1000+ concurrent users
4. Comprehensive analytics and reporting
5. Security compliance and data protection
6. Scalable deployment architecture

## Timeline
- **Phase 1**: Core e-commerce API (Products, Cart, Orders) - 4 weeks
- **Phase 2**: Advanced features (Analytics, Search, Recommendations) - 4 weeks  
- **Phase 3**: Optimization and production readiness - 2 weeks

## Constraints
- Must use Flask Python framework
- PostgreSQL as primary database
- RESTful API design principles
- Comprehensive documentation and testing
- Production-ready code quality standards
